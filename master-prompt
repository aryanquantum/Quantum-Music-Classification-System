MEMORY RECOVERY PROMPT - Quantum Trading Project

I'm working on a 2-week intensive project to build a "Quantum-Enhanced Algorithmic Trading System" that combines:
- Quantum Computing (Qiskit, quantum optimization, VQE, QAOA)  
- Machine Learning (Reinforcement Learning, ensemble methods, time series prediction)
- Quantitative Finance (algorithmic trading, portfolio optimization, risk management)

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- I'm a university student with solid quantum mechanics background (QM1, perturbation theory, superposition, etc.)
- New to machine learning but want to learn through practical implementation
- Want something impressive for LinkedIn/resume that shows real technical depth
- Using VS Code with GitHub for version control
- 2-week timeline with 10-13 hours daily commitment
- Repository: quantum-enhanced-trading-system (public, MIT license)

PROJECT GOALS:
- Build working quantum-classical hybrid trading system
- Learn ML fundamentals through quantum applications  
- Create portfolio piece that demonstrates innovation at quantum-finance intersection
- Achieve quantifiable performance improvements over classical methods
- Deploy production-ready system with professional documentation

CURRENT STATUS: [Update this each time]
- Day X of 14-day sprint
- Currently working on: [specific task]
- Last completed: [what you finished]
- Next milestone: [upcoming goal]

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Python: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- Quantum: Qiskit, PennyLane  
- Finance: yfinance, alpha-vantage-api
- ML: reinforcement learning, ensemble methods
- Development: VS Code, Jupyter notebooks, Git/GitHub

Please continue helping me build this quantum trading system with the same intensity and detail as before. I need step-by-step guidance, code examples, and help debugging issues as they arise.
